Euclid (ancient Greek mathematician) proved that there are five of such solids: the cube, dodecahedron, icosahedron, octahedron, and tetrahedron. The name of Platonic solids was given due the Athenian philosopher Plato, who in his dialogue Timaeus related four of the regular polyhedra with the four basic elements (fire, air, water, and earth), which were believed to compose all the matter through their combinations, and the fifth polyhedron was associated heaven and the constellations. The tetrahedron was assigned to fire, the cube to earth, the octahedron to air, the icosahedron to water, and the dodecahedron to heaven and constellations.",

The solar system has other interesting points, like a moon around the earth in which it has a strong influence on the tides and waves in the oceans. On Saturn, you can see a cloud made up of rocks and ring-shaped particles that orbit the planet.",

It would be easier for common people to understand all of those plans and sketches if there were also a 3D representation of the building where they could walk through, mostly if it was in Virtual Reality. Architects often have 3D modeling skills already, but the various software they use to build their models usually do not have support for ease navigation nor augmented and virtual reality (AR and VR). This apps aims to solve that problem, supplying the 3D navigation and the AR and VR support for the already created 3D model.",

The motion can be split in two components: the vertical component (y) and the horizontal component (x). The gravity pulls the object down, thus this force acts only on the velocity of the vertical component (vy). The velocity in the horizontal component (vx) will remain constant along the object’s path.",

It involves a real situation of sliding of a block on an inclined plane and focuses on analyzing how the forces act on it in this scenario. It is usually guided by three basic forces: Weight, Normal and Friction. We have the decomposition of the Weight on the X axis and the Y axis. The Normal force will act in the opposite direction to the Weight in Y and the frictional force will be opposite to the weight in X, so the greater the frictional force, the less the block will move or remain stationary, however, otherwise, the block will descend the inclined plane with greater or lesser speed depending on the frictional force. The below application shows a simulation of this scenary with the forces diagram and the main equations.",
